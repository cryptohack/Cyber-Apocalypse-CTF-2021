# PhaseStream 3

## Description:

* The aliens have learned the stupidity of their misunderstanding of Kerckhoffs's principle.
* Now they're going to use a well-known stream cipher (AES in CTR mode) with a strong key. And they'll happily give us poor humans the source because they're so confident it's secure!

## Objective:

Use known plaintext to recover the keystream.

## Flag:

* See `flag.txt`

## Difficulty:

* Easy

## Release:

* [release/phasestream3.py](release/phasestream3.py)
* [release/output.txt](release/output.txt)
