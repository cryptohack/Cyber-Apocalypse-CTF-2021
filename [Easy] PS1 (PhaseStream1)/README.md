# PhaseStream 1

## Description:

* The aliens are trying to build a secure cipher to encrypt all our games called "PhaseStream". They've heard that stream ciphers are pretty good.
* The aliens have learned of the XOR operation which is used to encrypt a plaintext with a key. They believe that XOR using a repeated 5-byte key is enough to build a strong stream cipher. Such silly aliens!
* Here's a flag they encrypted this way earlier. Can you decrypt it (hint: what's the flag format?)
* `2e313f2702184c5a0b1e321205550e03261b094d5c171f56011904`

## Objective:

* Use the flag format to recover the key. Can be done easily in CyberChef.

## Flag:

* See `flag.txt`

## Difficulty:

* Easy

## Release:

* No source code shared. Just provide this hex output of `create.py`: `2e313f2702184c5a0b1e321205550e03261b094d5c171f56011904`
