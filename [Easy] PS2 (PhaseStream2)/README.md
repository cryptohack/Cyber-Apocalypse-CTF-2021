# PhaseStream 2

## Description:

* The aliens have learned of a new concept called "security by obscurity". Fortunately for us they think it is a great idea and not a description of a common mistake.
* We've intercepted some alien comms and think they are XORing flags with a single-byte key and hiding the result inside 9999 lines of random data, Can you find the flag?

## Objective:

Write a script to process each line of data, try each key and see which one produces a flag. Easily optimised by getting the key that makes the first char "C" and trying that.

## Flag:

* See `flag.txt`

## Difficulty:

* Easy

## Release:

* [release/output.txt](release/output.txt)
